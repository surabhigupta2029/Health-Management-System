## Business Domain ##
Older patients find it challenging to keep track of their healthcare requirements such as taking medications at certain times and forget doctor appointments unless reminded frequently. Our goal was to enhance the quality of their life by creating a tool that effectively tracks and manages their medication and appointment needs. 

## State of the Art ##
Currently, there are apps and other services to compensate for this issue; for instance, there are applications created by local hospitals and generic services like Google Calendars. However, they might be hard to navigate because of ineffective UI design and might not meet all demands of the patient, especially the older patients.

## Our Solution ##
Our solution is to implement a tracker for prescriptions and upcoming appointments.This solution will stand out from the rest as it is geared towards older patients who might not have the best methods to track their healthcare needs. Therefore, the interface and navigation will be designed to be simplistic. The fact that our product will be a web application, will be a key differentiator when competing against competition. This is because caretakers and other family members can also interact on this platform through various devices like tablets, laptops etc. There is no limitation to it just being a mobile application.
